# Hey there!
this is just gonna go over some of the controls for the game! Keep in mind that the game is REALLY early in development and has a LOT of work to do.
Unfortunately there isnt much and all the sprites are the same :(. But, square on far right side is a note, to the direct left of that is infinite ammo
and the north-most square is a save button! (start game on the menu doesn't work until this is interacted with)

So, here are the controls:
F - interact
G - Flashlight toggle
Tab - Open/Close journal
R - Reload
LMB - Shoot
Shift - Sprint

Also, DO NOT OPEN YOUR JOURNAL AND INVENTORY AT THE SAME TIME, it bricks your game lol
(just figured this out so I cba to fix it)
